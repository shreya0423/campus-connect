## College Enquiry Chatbot

This project is a web-based College Enquiry Chatbot designed to assist students by answering common college-related queries through an interactive chat interface. The system uses machine learning techniques to analyze user questions and provide relevant responses about courses, fees, location, and general campus information.

The application reduces the need for in-person enquiries by offering instant automated responses. It includes user authentication features (registration, login, password recovery), a suggestion/feedback module, and a graphical chat interface that simulates real-time conversation.

### Technologies Used

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
* Backend: Python
* Framework: Flask
* Database: MySQL

### Key Features

* Interactive chatbot interface for student queries
* Secure user login and registration system
* Automated response generation based on user input
* Suggestion box for feedback collection
* Simple and user-friendly GUI

This project demonstrates practical implementation of web development, database integration, and basic NLP/ML concepts to build an automated enquiry system.
